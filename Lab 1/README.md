# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.
3. (extra: Learn about what exactly Git is from [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).)

### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Lab Overview
For this assignment, you are going to:

A) [Plan](#part-a-plan) 

B) [Act out the interaction](#part-b-act-out-the-interaction) 

C) [Prototype the device](#part-c-prototype-the-device)

D) [Wizard the device](#part-d-wizard-the-device) 

E) [Costume the device](#part-e-costume-the-device)

F) [Record the interaction](#part-f-record)

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Plan 
The interactive device can be anything *except* a computer, a tablet computer or a smart phone, but the main way it interacts needs to be using light.

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*
The setting of the interaction is the front door or any living space, and the area that immediately connects to it. The players in this scenario consist of a single person who is gathering their wallet, cellphone, mask, keys and other essential items on their way out in the morning. This individual is in a hurry, and in a moment of distraction, they leave their keys on the table before leaving their apartment. The door closes behind them and they are locked out. The main interactive devices are a proximity sensor built into the door handle that scans when the handle is turned, a fob on the users's key ring, and a light display built into the door.

\*\***Include a picture of your storyboard here**\*\*

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*
This interaction played out very closely to the storyboarding because of how simple the basic premise is.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*


## Part C. Prototype the device
\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*
The library was awesome once it was up an running. The node version worked right away. To use the python version we had to set up a virtual environment using python 3.9 first. Once we did that, it ran like a dream.

## Part D. Wizard the device

## Part E. Costume the device

The biggest opportunity would be to integrate the device into the door itself, such that it is replaceable / exchangeable but also so that it is flush with the door surface to avoid accidentally knocking it off and onto the floor

## Part F. Record

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
